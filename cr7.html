			<h1> Summary of Ronaldo's career</h1>
			<p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu] (born 5 February 1985), better known as Ronaldo, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward. He is the captain of the Portuguese national team, and he is currently playing at Saudi Arabian football club Al Nassr.
				He is considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time.[9][10][11][12][13][14]
				
				Ronaldo began his professional career with Sporting CP at age 17 in 2002 and signed for Manchester United a year later. He won three back-to-back Premier League titles in 2006-07, 2007-08, and 2008-09. In 2007-08, Ronaldo helped United win the UEFA Champions League. In 2008-09, he won his first World Cup in December 2008 and his first Ballon d'Or. At one point Ronaldo was the most expensive professional footballer of all time, after moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid for approximately £80 m in July 2009. In 2009, Ronaldo was included in the "World Player of the Decade 2000s", ranking third behind Lionel Messi (who came second) and Ronaldinho (who came first).[15]
				
				He won his first trophy with Real Madrid in 2011, the 2010-11 Copa del Rey. In the next season, he won the club's first La Liga title, the 2011-12 La Liga. In the 2012-13 season, he won the Supercopa de España. In the next season, the 2013-14 season, he won his second Ballon d'Or. Then he won the Copa del Rey, and he also won his second Champions League with a record 17 goals. The following year, Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or again, along with his second FIFA Club World Cup in December 2014. In 2016, Ronaldo won his third Champions League, and scored the winning penalty in the final against Atlético Madrid. He won his fourth Ballon d'Or the next season, his second La Liga title for the first time in five years, another Champions League, and his second Club World Cup. Ronaldo's last season with Real Madrid was the 2017-18 season, where he won his fifth Ballon d'Or in 2017, and also won his fifth Champions League and scored two goals in the final against Juventus. With his third consecutive Champions League, he became the first player to win the UEFA Champions League five times.[16] He would later go on to transfer to Juventus in July 2018. Ronaldo left the club holding the record for being the top goal scorer in Real Madrid's history and remaining the only player in La Liga's history to score 30 or more goals in six consecutive seasons.[17]
				
				Ronaldo began his career with Portugal at age 18. He scored his first goal at UEFA Euro 2004 and helped Portugal reach the final, although they lost to Greece 1-0. The first World Cup he played at was the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He scored a goal and helped Portugal earn fourth place. Two years later, he became Portugal's full captain. Since then, he has appeared at four Euro's: 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. He has also appeared at three World Cups: 2014, 2018, and 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

			<h2>In Real Madrid</h2>
			<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0) ; width: 1150px;  ">  Ronaldo joined Real Madrid on 1 July 2009 for a fee of €94 million. That was a world record transfer fee at the time. He also signed a six-year contract with the club.[33] At his presentation as a Real Madrid player, 80,000 people greeted him at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. This is the world record, breaking the 25-year record of 75,000 people at Diego Maradona's presentation for Napoli.[34] He wore the number 9 in his first season because number 7 was taken by Raúl González. Ronaldo had to wait until Raul left the club in the summer of 2010 to wear number 7.[35] He made his debut (first appearance) on 29 August 2009, in a La Liga game against Deportivo de La Coruña. He scored a goal and Real Madrid won 3-2. On 23 October 2010, Ronaldo scored 4 goals in a match for the first time in his career during a 6-1 win against Racing de Santander.[36] Ronaldo scored a header in extra time in the 2011 Copa del Rey final against rivals Barcelona. His goal was the match-winner, so that was Ronaldo's first trophy in Spain.[37] At the end of the 2010-11 season, he became the first player to score 40 goals in La Liga.[38]

				On 2 November 2011, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2-0 Champions League group stage win against Olympique Lyon. The second goal was his 100th goal for Real Madrid. He achieved this in just 105 matches.[39][40] He scored his 100th La Liga goal for his club in just 92 appearances in a 5-1 win against Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012.[41]
				
				Ronaldo began the 2012-13 season by winning the 2012 Supercopa de España. He scored in both legs, as Real Madrid won against Barca.[42] In October 2012, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4-1 win against Ajax.[43] On 6 January 2013, Ronaldo captained his club for the first time.[44] In May 2013, he scored his 200th goal for Real Madrid in a 6-2 win against Málaga.[45] He finished as the Champions League top scorer that season. Ronaldo won his second Ballon d'Or in 2013.[46]
				
				In the 2013-14 season, Ronaldo broke the record for most goals in one Champions League season by scoring his 17th goal with a penalty in extra time in the final against Atlético Madrid that Real Madrid won 4–1.[47] The previous record was 14 goals, set by Messi in the 2011-12 season.
				
				In the 2014-15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal record by scoring 61 goals in all competitions. This achievement helped him win his third Ballon d'Or.[48] He scored five goals in one match for the first time in his career in a 9-1 win vs. Granada on 5 April 2015.[49] He became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer when he scored 5 goals against RCD Espanyol in a 6-0 away win on 12 September 2015. This brought his total goal tally to 230 goals in 203 games. The previous record holder was Raul.[50][51]
				
				On 18 April 2017, he became the first player to reach 100 goals in the UEFA Champions League, after he scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 extra-time win against Bayern Munich.[52] On 18 March 2018, Ronaldo reached his 50th career hat-trick in a 6-3 win against Girona.[53] Ronaldo scored an amazing bicycle-kick in a UEFA Champions League match against Juventus on 3 April 2018. He got a standing ovation, or round of applause, from the Juventus fans after scoring that goal.[54] Real Madrid went on to play the final against Liverpool F.C.. Real Madrid became champions, so that was Ronaldo's 5th Champions League.[55]</p>

				<h2> goals of career</h2>
			<p class="mm" >Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 880 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.

				Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018,
				 including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for
				  an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.</p>

			<h2> life style </h2>
			<p class="mm">Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players,
				which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing
				tackles;
				[34][35] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").
				[36][37][38] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which,
				combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical
				challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with
				playacting.
				[19][35][39] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick
				feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.
				[40] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster
				with the ball than he does without it."[41] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot
				since his mid-20s,
				Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins
				dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[42][43]

				A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to
				make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role,
				courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[44] He has often been described as a magician;
				a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[45][46][47] Moreover,
				he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.
				[35][48] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with
				65,[49] the most among active players.[50] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[51]</p>
